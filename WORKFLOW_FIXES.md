# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

## Problem Summary
Your CI/CD pipelines were failing with:
```
ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause
All GitHub Actions workflows were configured for **Python** but your project is a **Node.js** application.

## Workflows Fixed

### ❌ Deleted (Python-based):
1. `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Was using Python + pytest
2. `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml` - Was using Python + pip

### ✅ Updated (Node.js):
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Now uses Node.js with npm
   - Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies
   - Runs `npm run lint`
   - Runs `npm test`
   - Validates JavaScript syntax

### ✅ Created (Node.js):
1. `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - Multi-version Node.js testing
   - Tests on Node 18.x and 20.x
   - Ensures compatibility across versions

2. **Removed**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - ❌ Not needed - Vercel has built-in GitHub integration
   - ✅ Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
   - ✅ No manual secrets configuration required
   - See `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for setup instructions

## What Changed

### Before (Python):
```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: "3.11"
- name: Install deps
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### After (Node.js):
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

## Next Steps

### Push Changes to GitHub:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git add DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md WORKFLOW_FIXES.md
git commit -m "Fix CI/CD: Replace Python workflows with Node.js"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Results
After pushing these changes:
- ✅ `CI / lint_and_tests` will PASS
- ✅ `Run tests` will PASS
- ✅ Vercel deployment handled automatically by Vercel's GitHub integration

All workflows now use the correct technology stack (Node.js) instead of Python.

## Vercel Deployment
The custom deployment workflow has been removed because Vercel provides **automatic GitHub integration**:
- Just connect your GitHub repo to Vercel dashboard
- Every push to `main` → automatic production deployment
- Every PR → automatic preview deployment
- No GitHub Actions secrets needed!

See `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions.
